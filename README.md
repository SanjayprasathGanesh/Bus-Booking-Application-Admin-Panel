In the admin platform of the Bus Booking app, administrators wield comprehensive control over bus operations. They can efficiently manage buses by adding, editing, or deleting them as needed. Admins have access to vital analytics, including total passenger counts and passenger lists for specific buses on particular dates. Moreover, super admins possess additional privileges such as creating new offer codes, adding new admins, drivers, routes, and overseeing various aspects of the application's functionality.
